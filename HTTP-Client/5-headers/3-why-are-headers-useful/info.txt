Why Are Headers Useful?

Headers are useful for several reasons from design to security, but most often headers are used for metadata about the request or response itself. For example, let's say we wanted to ask for a player's level from the Jello server. We need to send that player's ID to the server so it knows which player to send back the information for. That ID is my request, it's not information about my request.

Authentication is a common use case for headers. If I ask Jello to complete a project, I need to provide authentication information that I'm logged in, but that auth info isn't the request itself, it's just additional information about the request.
