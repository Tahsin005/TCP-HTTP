URL Paths

The URL Path comes right after the domain (or port if one is provided) in a URL string.

In this URL: `http://testdomain.com/root/next`
The path is: /root/next


Path Conventions

Many static websites (websites where the content does not change, as opposed to dynamic web applications) use paths as a direct mapping to the path to the server's file system. For example, If I was running a static web server for "mystaticstate.com" from the root of my file system, a GET request to http://mystaticstate.com/documents/hello.txt would serve the file at /documents/hello.txt from my server.

Most dynamic web applications don't use this simple mapping of URL path -> file path. Technically, a URL path is just a string that the web server can do what it wants with, and modern websites take advantage of that flexibility. Some common examples of what paths are used for include:

    The hierarchy of pages on a website, whether or not that reflects a server's file structure
    Parameters passed into an HTTP request, like the ID of a resource
    The version of the API
    The type of resource being requested
