URL Query Parameters

A URL's query parameters appear next in the URL structure but are not always present - they're optional. For example:

https://www.google.com/search?q=boot.dev

q=boot.dev is a query parameter. Like headers, query parameters are key / value pairs. In this case, q is the key and boot.dev is the value.
