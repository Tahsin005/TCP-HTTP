The Documentation of an HTTP Server

You may be wondering:

    How the heck am I supposed to memorize how all these different servers work???

The good news is that you don't need to. When you work with a backend server, it's the responsibility of that server's developers to provide you with instructions, or documentation that explains how to interact with it. For example, the documentation should tell you:

    The domain of the server
    The resources you can interact with (HTTP paths)
    The supported query parameters
    The supported HTTP methods
    Anything else you'll need to know to work with the server


The Server Is the Captain Now

The server has complete control over how the path in a URL is interpreted and used in a request. The same goes for query parameters. While there are a lot of strong conventions around how servers should interpret paths and query parameters, the server can do whatever it wants. That's why you need docs.



When working with a backend server, you will need access to ____
- The server's API documentation

What should you do if the documentation isn't clear about how to use the API?
- Contact with the backend developers and ask for better documentation
