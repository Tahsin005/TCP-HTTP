A URI, or Uniform Resource Identifier, is a unique character sequence that identifies a resource that is (almost always) accessed via the internet.

Just like Golang has syntax rules, so do URIs. These rules help ensure uniformity so that any program can interpret the meaning of the URI in the same way.

URIs come in two main types:

    URLs
    URNs

A URL specifies the location of a resource on the internet, while a URN identifies a resource by name, regardless of its location.
