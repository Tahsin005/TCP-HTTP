There are 8 main parts to a URL, though not all the sections are always present. Each piece plays a role in helping clients locate the droids resources they're looking for.

Part 	    Required
Protocol 	Yes
Username 	No
Password 	No
Domain 	    Yes
Port 	    No (defaults to 80 or 443)
Path 	    No (defaults to /)
Query 	    No
Fragment 	No

Port 80:
    Default for HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol).
    Unencrypted traffic.
    When you type http://example.com, the browser assumes port 80.
    Example URL (explicit port shown):
        http://example.com:80/

Port 443:
    Default for HTTPS (HTTP Secure).
    Encrypted traffic (uses TLS/SSL).
    Protects against eavesdropping and tampering.
    When you type https://example.com, the browser assumes port 443.
    Example URL (explicit port shown):
        https://example.com:443/


http://jello.app is a valid URL.
    Protocol: http:// → present ✔ (uses port 80 by default).
    Domain: jello.app → valid domain ✔ (TLD .app is a real Google-owned TLD).
    Path: not specified → defaults to / ✔.

http://username:password is not a valid URL
    This is NOT a valid URL because:
    It has no host (domain or IP) after the credentials.
    The @ symbol is missing — you need it to separate the credentials from the host.
