The "protocol" (also referred to as the "scheme") is the first component of a URL. It defines the rules by which the data being communicated is displayed, encoded or formatted.

Some examples of different URL protocols:

    http
    ftp
    mailto
    https

For example:

    http://example.com
    mailto:noreply@jello.app

Not All Schemes Require a “//”

The "http" in a URL is always followed by ://. All URLs have the colon, but the // part is only included for schemes that have an authority component. As you can see above, the mailto scheme doesn't use an authority component, so it doesn't need the slashes.
