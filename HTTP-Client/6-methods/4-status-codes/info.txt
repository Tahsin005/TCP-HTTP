Status Codes

The Status Code of an HTTP response tells the client whether or not the server was able to fulfill the request. Status codes are 3-digit numbers that are grouped into categories:

    100-199: Informational responses. These are very rare.
    200-299: Successful responses. Hopefully, most responses are 200's!
    300-399: Redirection messages. These are typically invisible because the browser or HTTP client will automatically do the redirect.
    400-499: Client errors. You'll see these often, especially when trying to debug a client application
    500-599: Server errors. You'll see these sometimes, usually only if there is a bug on the server.

Here are some of the most common status codes, but there is also a full list here if you're interested.

    200 - OK. This is by far the most common code, it just means that everything worked as expected.
    201 - Created. This means that a resource was created successfully. Typically in response to a POST request.
    301 - Moved permanently. This means the resource was moved to a new place, and the response will include where that new place is. Websites often use 301 redirects when they change their domain name, for example.
    400 - Bad request. A general error indicating the client made a mistake in their request.
    401 - Unauthorized. This means the client doesn't have the correct permissions. Maybe they didn't include a required authorization header, for example.
    404 - Not found. You'll see this on websites quite often. It just means the resource doesn't exist.
    500 - Internal server error. This means something went wrong on the server, likely a bug on their end.


The purpose of status codes is to ____
- Inform the client about whether or not the request was succesful
