HTTPS

Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure or HTTPS is an extension of the HTTP protocol. HTTPS secures the data transfer between client and server by encrypting all of the communication.

HTTPS allows a client to safely share sensitive information with the server through an HTTP request, such as credit card information, passwords, or bank account numbers.
