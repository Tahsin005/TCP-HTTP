cURL POST Request

Making a POST request with cURL is almost as simple as a GET request. Use the -X POST option to specify the request method and the -d option to pass data.


Here's how to make a POST request:

    curl -X POST http://example.com/resource -d "param1=value1&param2=value2"


This command makes an HTTP POST request to http://example.com/resource with the data param1=value1&param2=value2. The server's response body is written to stdout.

If you need to send JSON data, use the -H option to set the Content-Type header and the -d option to pass the JSON data:

    curl -X POST http://example.com/resource -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"key1":"value1","key2":"value2"}'
